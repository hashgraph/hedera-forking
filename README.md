# Hedera Forking Support for System Contracts

## Sample Usage On forked networks

This repository includes the example Smart Contract referenced in this [issue](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-smart-contracts/issues/863).

### Fixing Your Tests

To set up and fix your Foundry tests with Hedera forking, follow these steps

1. **Install the Hedera Forking Library**

   ```shell
   forge install git@github.com:hashgraph/hedera-forking.git
   ```

2. **Add Setup Code in Your Test Files**
   Include the following lines in the setup phase of your tests to deploy the required contract code and enable cheat codes:

   ```solidity
   deployCodeTo("HtsSystemContractInitialized.sol", address(0x167));
   vm.allowCheatcodes(address(0x167));
   ```

### Running the Tests

To run the tests and observe the setup in action, use the following command

```shell
forge test --fork-url "https://mainnet.hashio.io/api" --chain 295 --match-contract DealCheatCodeIssueTest
```

### Requirements

To use this library in your tests, you need to enable `ffi`. You can do this by adding the following lines to your `.toml` file:

```toml
[profile.default]
ffi = true
```

Alternatively, you can add the `--ffi` flag to your execution script.
This is necessary because our library uses `surl`, which relies on `ffi` to make requests.

## Hardhat

### Hashgraph Plugin for HardHat

This plugin replaces the default HardHat provider with one specifically designed for testing on the Hedera network.
It enables the following features

- **Hedera Precompile Support** Assigns the Hedera precompile code to the `0x167` address.
  During tests, you'll be able to query Hedera token data as though they are stored on standard blockchains.
  Currently, only fungible tokens are supported to a limited degree.
- **Token Proxy Address Storage** Sets up token proxy addresses by directly querying data from the Hedera MirrorNode, giving you access to real-time account balances, allowances, and token information (such as name, symbol, and decimals) in the IERC20 format for fungible tokens.
  Please note that only fungible tokens are supported at this time.

### Installation

To use this plugin, install it via `npm`

```console
npm install @hashgraph/hardhat-forking-plugin
```

Next, add the following line to the top of your HardHat config file `hardhat.config.js`

```javascript
require('@hashgraph/hardhat-forking-plugin');
```

This will automatically replace the default HardHat provider with the one dedicated to the Hedera network.
You can then proceed with writing your tests, and the plugin will allow you to query Hedera token data seamlessly.

### Configuration

By default, the plugin uses the Hedera Mirror Node based on the guessed chain ID from the currently forked network.

The value of the configuration parameter: hardhat.forking.url will be used to infer the initial chain ID.

Only chain IDs 295 (Mainnet), 296 (Testnet), and 297 (Previewnet) are supported.

### Endpoints with Altered Behavior

The first RPC call using the Hardhat provider will set up the HTS bytecode via the JSON RPC method `hardhat_setCode`.

This operation will only work if the precompile address is not already occupied by an existing smart contract on your network. Forks of networks with no code deployed to the `0x167` address are required for this functionality.

Each time the `eth_call` method is invoked, the target address will be checked to see if it represents a token by querying the MirrorNode. Its basic storage fields (such as name, balance, decimals, etc.) will be set using the `hardhat_setStorageAt` method.

If the function selector in the `eth_call` request corresponds to any of the following functions, an additional operation will be performed, as described below:

| Function                     | Behavior                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `balanceOf(address)`         | Sets the balance of the address (downloaded from MirrorNode) into the storage slot from where it will be queried.                                                                           |
| `allowance(address,address)` | Sets the token spending allowance for the address from the first parameter to the second parameter, after retrieving the data from the MirrorNode, and stores it in the corresponding slot. |

Additionally, by loading the HTS and token code into the EVM, the following methods can be called on the token's address, functioning similarly to how they would on the actual Hedera EVM:

| Function                                | Behavior                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name()`                                | Returns the token's name.                                                                     |
| `symbol()`                              | Returns the token's symbol.                                                                   |
| `decimals()`                            | Returns the token's decimals.                                                                 |
| `totalSupply()`                         | Returns the token's total supply.                                                             |
| `balanceOf(address)`                    | Returns the balance of the specified address.                                                 |
| `allowance(address,address)`            | Returns the allowance for the specified address to spend tokens on behalf of another address. |
| `transfer(address,uint256)`             | Transfers a specified amount of tokens from the caller to the provided address.               |
| `transferFrom(address,address,uint256)` | Transfers a specified amount of tokens from one address to another.                           |
| `approve(address,uint256)`              | Approves an address to spend a specified number of tokens.                                    |

**Note:** Currently, only **fungible tokens** are supported.

### Publishing

In order to publish updated version of the plugin run

```bash
npm publish
```

and follow prompted instructions.
Privilege to add projects to the `@hashgraph` namespace are required.

## Background

**Fork Testing** (or **WaffleJS Fixtures**) is an Ethereum Development Environment feature that optimizes test execution for Smart Contracts.
It enables snapshotting of blockchain state, saving developement time by avoiding the recreation of the entire blockchain state for each test.
Instead, tests can revert to a pre-defined snapshot, streamlining the testing process.
Most populars Ethereum Development Environments provide this feature, such as
[Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/fork-testing) and
[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/docs/overview#mainnet-forking).

This feature is enabled by their underlaying Development network, for example

- Hardhat's [EJS (EthereumJS VM)](https://github.com/nomicfoundation/ethereumjs-vm) and [EDR (Ethereum Development Runtime)](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/edr)
- Foundry's [Anvil](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/crates/anvil)
- [Ganache _(deprecated)_](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache)

Please note that WaffleJS, when used directly as a library, _i.e._, not inside a Hardhat project,
[uses Ganache internally](https://github.com/TrueFiEng/Waffle/blob/238c11ccf9bcaf4b83c73eca16d25243c53f2210/waffle-provider/package.json#L47).

On the other hand, Geth support some sort of snapshotting with <https://geth.ethereum.org/docs/interacting-with-geth/rpc/ns-debug#debugsethead>,
but itâ€™s not commonly used for development and testing of Smart Contracts.

Moreover, given that Fork testing runs on a local development network, users can use `console.log` in tests to ease the debugging process.
With `console.log`, you can print logging messages and contract variables calling `console.log` from your Solidity code.
Both [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge-std/console-log) and [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/debugging-with-hardhat-network) support `console.log`.
Not being able to use Forking (see below) implies also not being able to use `console.log` in tests,
which cause frustration among Hedera users.

### Can Hedera developers use Fork Testing?

**Yes**, Fork Testing works well when the Smart Contracts are standard EVM Smart Contracts that do not involve Hedera-specific services.
This is because fork testing is targeted at the local test network provided by the Ethereum Development Environment.
These networks are somewhat replicas of the Ethereum network and do not support Hedera-specific services.

**No**, Fork Testing will not work on Hedera for contracts that are specific to Hedera.
For example, if a contract includes calls to the `createFungibleToken` method on the HTS System Contract at `address(0x167)`.
This is because the internal local test network provided by the framework (`chainId: 1337`) does not have the precompiled HTS contract deployed at `address(0x167)`.

This project is an attempt to solve this problem.
It does so by providing an emulation layer for HTS written in Solidity.
Given it is written in Solidity, it can executed in a development network environment, such as Foundry or Hardhat.

## Overview

This project has two main parts

- **[`HtsSystemContract.sol`](./src/HtsSystemContract.sol) Solidity Contract**.
  This contract provides an emulator for the Hedera Token Service written in Solidity.
  It is specially designed to work in a forked network.
  Its storage reads and writes are crafted to be reversible in a way the `hedera-forking` package can fetch the appropriate data.
- **[`@hashgraph/hedera-forking`](./index.js) CommonJS Package**.
  Provides functions that can be hooked into the Relay to fetch the appropiate data when HTS System Contract (at address `0x167`) or Hedera Tokens are invoked.
  This package uses the compilation output of the `HtsSystemContract` contract to return its bytecode and to map storage slots to field names.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The compilation output of `HtsSystemContract` is version controlled.
> The benefit of including a generated file is that it allows the Relay to consume the JS package directly [from GitHub](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json#git-urls-as-dependencies).
> This is also the reason we use [_JSDoc_](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html) instead of TypeScript, to avoid the compilation step.
> This, in turn, avoids publishing an `npm` package.

### How does it Work?

The following sequence diagram showcases the messages sent between components when fork testing is activated within an Ethereum Development Environment, _e.g._, Foundry or Hardhat.

> [!NOTE]
> The JSON-RPC Relay service is not shown here because is not involved when performing a requests for a Token.

The relevant interactions are

- **(5).** This is the code defined by [HIP-719](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-719#specification).
  For reference, you can see the
  [`hedera-services`](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/blob/fbac99e75c27bf9c70ebc78c5de94a9109ab1851/hedera-node/hedera-smart-contract-service-impl/src/main/java/com/hedera/node/app/service/contract/impl/state/DispatchingEvmFrameState.java#L96)
  implementation.
- **(6)**-**(7)**. This calls `getHtsCode` which in turn returns the bytecode compiled from `HtsSystemContract.sol`.
- **(8)**-**(12)**. This calls `getHtsStorageAt` which uses the `HtsSystemContract`'s [Storage Layout](#storage-layout) to fetch the appropriate state from the Mirror Node. The **(8)** JSON-RPC call is triggered as part of the `redirectForToken(address,bytes)` method call defined in HIP-719.
  Even if the call from HIP-719 is custom encoded, this method call should support standard ABI encoding as well as defined in
  [`hedera-services`](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/blob/b40f81234acceeac302ea2de14135f4c4185c37d/hedera-node/hedera-smart-contract-service-impl/src/main/java/com/hedera/node/app/service/contract/impl/exec/systemcontracts/common/AbstractCallAttempt.java#L91-L104).

## Build

This repo consists of two projects/packages.
A Foundry project, to compile and test the `HtsSystemContract.sol` contract.
And an `npm` package that implements the `eth_getCode` and `eth_getStorageAt` JSON-RPC calls when HTS emulation is involved.

To compile the `HtsSystemContract` and test contracts

```console
forge build
```

> [!TIP]
> Keep in mind the compilation output of `HtsSystemContract` is versioned.
> So it will appear as modified after `forge build` when `HtsSystemContract` has been changed.

There is no compilation step to build the `@hashgraph/hedera-forking` package.
However, you can type-check it by running

```console
npm run type-check
```

## Tests

> [!TIP]
> The [`launch-token`](./launch-token/) script was used to deploy Tokens using HTS to `testnet` for testing purposes.

### `getHtsCode` and `getHtsStorageAt` Unit Tests

These tests only involve testing both `getHtsCode` and `getHtsStorageAt` functions.
In other words, they do not use the `HtsSystemContract` bytecode, only its `storageLayout` definition.

```console
npm run test
```

### `HtsSystemContract` Solidity tests + local storage emulation (_without_ forking)

Foundry provides a Std Storage library, _"that makes manipulating storage easy"_.
See <https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge-std/std-storage> for more information.

We use the Std Storage library to provide local storage emulation that allow us to run `HtsSystemContract` Solidity tests without starting out a separate JSON-RPC process.

```console
forge test
```

> [!NOTE]
> When running these tests **without** forking from a remote network,
> the package `@hashgraph/hedera-forking` is not under test.

### `HtsSystemContract` Solidity tests + JSON-RPC mock server for storage emulation (_with_ forking)

These Solidity tests are used to test both the `HtsSystemContract` and the `@hashgraph/hedera-forking` package.
Instead of starting a `local-node` or using a remote network,
they use the [`json-rpc-mock.js`](./scripts/json-rpc-mock.js) script as a backend without the need for any additional service.
This is the network Foundry's Anvil is forking from.

In a separate terminal run the JSON-RPC Mock Server

```console
./scripts/json-rpc-mock.js
```

Then run

```console
forge test --fork-url http://localhost:7546 --no-storage-caching
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `--no-storage-caching` flag disables the JSON-RPC calls cache,
> which is important to make sure the `json-rpc-mock.js` is reached in each JSON-RPC call.
> See <https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-test#description> for more information.

You can use the `--match-contract` flag to filter the tests to be executed if needed.
In addition, usually when debugging the contract under test we are interested in getting the Solidity traces.
We can use the `forge` flag `-vvvv` to display them.
For example

```console
forge test --match-contract TokenTest -vvvv
```

### `HtsSystemContract` Solidity tests + Relay for storage emulation (with forking)

These tests are the same of the section above, but instead of using the `json-rpc-mock.js` it uses the Relay with `hedera-forking` enabled pointing to `testnet`.

## Storage Layout

The Solidity compiler `solc` provides an option to generate detailed storage layout information as part of the build output.
This feature can be enabled by selecting the `storageLayout` option,
which provides insights into how variables are stored in contract storage.

### Enabling Storage Layout

**In Hardhat.**

To generate the storage layout using Hardhat,
you need to modify the Hardhat configuration file `hardhat.config.js` as follows

```javascript
module.exports = {
  solidity: {
    settings: {
      outputSelection: {
        '*': {
          '*': ['storageLayout'],
        },
      },
    },
  },
};
```

With this configuration, the storage layout information will be included in the build artifacts.
You can find this information in the following path within the build output

```txt
output -> contracts -> ContractName.sol -> ContractName -> storageLayout
```

**In Foundry.**

Add the following line to your `foundry.toml` file

```toml
extra_output = ["storageLayout"]
```

The `storageLayout` object is included in the output file `out/<Contract name>.sol/<Contract name>.json`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is the one used in this project.

### Understanding the Storage Layout Format

The storage layout is represented in JSON format with the following fields

- **`astId`**. The identifier in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- **`contract`**. The name of the contract.
- **`label`**. The name of the instance variable.
- **`offset`**. The starting location of the variable within a `uint256` storage word.
  Multiple variables may be packed into a single memory slot when their types are smaller than a 32 bytes word.
  In such cases, the `offset` value for the second and subsequent variables will differ from `0`.
- **`slot`**. A integer representing the slot number in storage.
- **`type`**. The type of the value stored in the slot.

See <https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/layout_in_storage.html#json-output> for more information.

### Application to Token Smart Contract Emulation

For the purpose of our implementation,
understanding which variable names are stored in specific slots is sufficient to develop a functional emulator for the token smart contract.

### Issues with Storage for Mappings, Arrays, and Strings Longer than 31 Bytes

When dealing with mappings, arrays, and strings longer than 31 bytes in Solidity, these data types do not fit entirely within a single storage slot. This creates challenges when trying to access or compute their storage locations.

### Accessing Mappings

For mappings, the value is not stored directly in the storage slot. Instead, to access a specific value in a mapping, you must first calculate the storage slot by computing the Keccak-256 hash of the concatenation of the "key" (the mapped value) and the "slot" number where the mapping is declared.

```solidity
bytes32 storageSlot = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(key, uint256(slotNumber)));
```

To reverse-engineer or retrieve the original key (e.g., an address or token ID) from a storage slot, you'd need to maintain a mapping of keys to their corresponding storage hashes, which can be cumbersome.

### Calculating Storage for User Addresses and Token IDs

For our current use case, where we need to calculate these values for user addresses and token IDs (which are integers), this is manageable

- **User Addresses**: Since the number of user accounts is limited, their mapping can be stored and referenced as needed.
- **Token IDs**: These are sequentially incremented integers, making it possible to precompute and store their corresponding storage slots on the Hedera JSON-RPC side.

### Handling Long Strings

Handling strings longer than 31 bytes is more complex

1. **Calculate the Slot Hash.** Start by calculating the Keccak-256 hash of the slot number where the string is stored.

   ```solidity
   bytes32 hashSlot = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(uint256(slotNumber)));
   ```

2. **Retrieve the Value.** Access the value stored at this hash slot. If the string exceeds 32 bytes, retrieve the additional segments from consecutive slots (_e.g._, `hashSlot + 1`, `hashSlot + 2`, _etc._), until the entire string is reconstructed.

This process requires careful calculation and multiple reads from storage to handle longer strings properly.
